Marley, who is intricately tied to Scrooge's past experiences, plays a significant role in the transformation of Scrooge's room and is a constant presence in Scrooge's life, even after his death. Their connection is highlighted by Scrooge's deep emotional response to Marley's ghostly appearance, which serves as a direct confrontation and a pivotal moment that impacts Scrooge's emotions and actions significantly.\n\nAs Scrooge's business partner and the executor of Marley's will, Scrooge is shown to have a significant personal and professional connection with Marley. This relationship is further emphasized by Scrooge's actions, such as signing Marley's burial register, which indicates a direct and formal relationship. The memory of Marley haunts Scrooge, symbolizing their strong past relationship and Marley's enduring impact on Scrooge's life. This is vividly illustrated when Scrooge sees Marley's face instead of his door knocker, a supernatural visitation that serves as a reminder of his past and the history that haunts him.\n\nScrooge's hesitation and fear when confronted with reminders of Marley suggest a deep personal connection and a history that continues to influence him.

Initially, Scrooge asks The Boy what day it is, leading to the discovery that it is indeed Christmas Day. This moment is pivotal as it signifies the beginning of Scrooge's realization and change of heart towards the Christmas spirit. Further demonstrating this change, Scrooge communicates with The Boy to inquire about and then decides to purchase a turkey. This indicates not only a direct interaction but also a gesture of goodwill from Scrooge, which is a departure from his previously known miserly behavior.\n\nScrooge then employs The Boy to buy and deliver the turkey, promising him a reward for quick service. This act of generosity is a clear indication of Scrooge's newfound benevolence and his desire to spread joy on Christmas Day. Additionally, Scrooge expresses regret for not having given something to the boy who was singing a Christmas carol, reflecting his remorse over past actions and his wish to make amends.\n\nTogether, these interactions between Scrooge and The Boy illustrate a significant shift in Scrooge's attitude and actions. From a man who once epitomized greed and indifference, Scrooge transforms into a figure of generosity and kindness, using his resources and influence to bring happiness to others, particularly on Christmas Day. This transformation is symbolized through his interactions with The Boy, who serves not only as a catalyst for Scrooge's change but also as a beneficiary of his newfound generosity.\",111\n153,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge is preparing to meet the second spirit sent as a messenger through Jacob Marley's intervention.\"\"\",111\n157,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE CITY STREETS\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge is brought to the city streets by the Spirit to observe and learn from the festive activities and atmosphere.\"\"\",111\n158,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE TOWN\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and the Spirit visit the suburbs of the Town, indicating Scrooge's connection to various locations during his journey.\"\"\",111\n164,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"TWELFTH-NIGHT PARTY\"\"\",\"Scrooge and the Ghost, also referred to as the Spirit, experience a significant event in their journey when they leave the Twelfth-Night Party together.
