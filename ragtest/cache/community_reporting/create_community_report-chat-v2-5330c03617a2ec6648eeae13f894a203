As a marine-store dealer and receiver of stolen goods, Joe's occupation places him in a morally questionable position, engaging in activities that skirt the edges of legality. His character comes to life in a significant scene where he is involved in a conversation about taking down bed-curtains, a moment that underscores his participation in either a posthumous theft or a poignant realization regarding the possessions of the deceased. This scene is pivotal, highlighting Joe's curiosity and concern about the items being discussed, which include the possessions of someone who has passed away.\n\nJoe's interactions reveal a multifaceted personality; on one hand, he is depicted as having a business-like demeanor, appraising and purchasing items with a professional eye. On the other hand, he exhibits a weakness for being overly generous with ladies, a trait that adds a humorous dimension to his character. This humor is further evidenced in his dealings with customers, where he expresses a lighthearted take on a woman's actions, suggesting a complexity to his character that goes beyond his questionable professional practices.\n\nMoreover, Joe's involvement in profiting from someone's death, as indicated by his production of a flannel bag with money, adds a darker layer to his character, suggesting a direct benefit from the misfortunes of others. Despite this, his engagement in dialogues about the deceased person's possessions, including a repeated mention of the taking down of bed-curtains, suggests a thematic exploration of the value placed on material possessions after death and the moral implications of profiting from them.\n\nIn summary, Joe is a character who navigates the murky waters between legality and immorality, his actions and interactions revealing a complex individual who is at once humorous, concerned, and morally ambiguous. His role in the narrative serves as a conduit for exploring themes of death, possession, and the ethical boundaries of profiting from the deceased, making him a pivotal figure in the unfolding story.\",4\n40,\"\"\"OLD SCRATCH\"\"\",\"\"\"Old Scratch\"\" is a term used in conversations to imply a person who has recently passed away or met some form of fate.
