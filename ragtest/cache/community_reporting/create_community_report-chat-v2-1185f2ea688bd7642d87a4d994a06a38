Her talents extend to playing the harp, where she contributes to her family's musical entertainment, showcasing her artistic side. Despite her apparent jovial nature, she exhibits a clear lack of patience for her uncle Scrooge, actively participating in conversations about his behavior and the negative consequences of his actions. This impatience is further highlighted in discussions with her husband about Scrooge's wealth, where she does not shy away from expressing her feelings towards her uncle's demeanor.\n\nMoreover, Scrooge's niece is not just a passive participant in these discussions; she encourages her cousin Fred to continue speaking about Scrooge, showing amusement at the situation.
